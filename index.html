                As a grunt in the Army of Red Mist, Mogul Khan set his sights
                 on the rank of Red Mist General. In battle after battle he 
                 proved his worth through gory deed. His rise through the 
                 ranks was helped by the fact that he never hesitated to 
                 decapitate a superior. Through the seven year Campaign 
                 of the Thousand Tarns, he distinguished himself in 
                 glorious carnage, his star of fame shining ever brighter,
                while the number of comrades in arms steadily dwindled. 
                On the night of ultimate victory, Axe declared himself
                the new Red Mist General, and took on the ultimate
                title of 'Axe.' But his troops now numbered zero. 
                Of course, many had died in battle, but a significant 
                number had also fallen to Axe's blade. Needless to say, 
                most soldiers now shun his leadership. But this matters 
                not a whit to Axe, who knows that a one-man army is by far the best.

                Drow Ranger's given name is Traxex--a name well suited to 
                the short, trollish, rather repulsive Drow people. But 
                Traxex herself is not a Drow. Her parents were travelers 
                in a caravan set upon by bandits, whose noisy slaughter of 
                innocents roused the ire of the quiet Drow people.

                After the battle settled, the Drow discovered a small girl-child hiding 
                in the ruined wagons, and agreed she could not be abandoned. 
                Even as child, Traxex showed herself naturally adept at the arts
                they prized: Stealth, silence, subtlety. In spirit, if not in physique,
                she might have been a Drow changeling, returned to her proper home. But
                as she grew, she towered above her family and came to think of herself 
                as ugly. After all, her features were smooth and symmetrical, entirely 
                devoid of warts and coarse whiskers.

                Estranged from her adopted tribe, she withdrew to live alone in the woods. 
                Lost travelers who find their way from the forest sometimes speak of an
                 impossibly beautiful Ranger who peered at them from deep among the trees, 
                 then vanished like a dream before they could approach. Lithe and stealthy, 
                 icy hot, she moves like mist in silence. That whispering you hear is her 
                 frozen arrows finding an enemy's heart.
